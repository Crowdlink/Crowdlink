          %h3 Overview
          %p
            %b 1.1 Definitions.
            Crowdlink is a platform for improving the development cycle for
            projects of any sort by bringing together users and developers to raise awareness
            of issues important to users. In this Agreement, the
            following terms have the following meanings:
            %ul
              %li
                %b "Projects"
                are products or services, either run by an individual or through collaborative efforts,
                presented on Crowdlink for feedback from users in the form of Proposals, Solutions, votes, or Donations.
              %li
                %b "Project Maintainers"
                are users that are responsible for determining the direction of a Project,
                and have the authority to accept or reject proposed Solutions, distribute Donations, and assign
                additional Project Administrators.
              %li
                %b "Project Administrators"
                are users that have elevated privledges on a Project. The Project
                Administrators group includes the Project Maintainer and may include users a Project Maintainer has
                given elevated privledges to.
              %li
                %b "Contributors"
                are users that create Proposals or Solutions, commit code, vote, Donate or Pledge funds
                towards a Solution or Project.
              %li
                %b "Donations"
                are funds donated by Contributors towards a Project with no implied conditions or stipulations.
              %li
                %b "Matured Funds"
                are Donations or Pledges that have been assigned to users and are available for withdrawal, or
                contributed towards other Solutions/Projects.
              %li
                %b "Immatured Funds"
                are funds in the Crowdlink system that are available for transfer between users, but
                are unavailable for withdrawal and will become Matured Funds at some point in the future.
              %li
                %b "Solutions"
                are proposed features or fixes to problems with a project
              %li
                %b "Accepted Solutions"
                are Solutions that have been marked as accepted by a Project Administrator.
              %li
                %b "Completed"
                means a Project Administrator has marked a Solution as being materially complete. Crowdlink
                expressly disclaims any responsibility for the accuracy of claims of completion.
              %li
                %b "Pledges"
                are funds donated by Contributors towards the completion of a specific Solution. These funds
                are held in escrow until such time as the Solution is marked as completed by a Project Administrator.
              %li
                %b "Assignees"
                are persons who are allotted funds from Donations or Pledges by a Project Administrator.
                It is highly encouraged that these be persons who are Contributors to the Project, although
                this is not required.
              %li
                %b "Reversal"
                is an action which may be taken by Crowdlink to remove funds which are represented as
                Donations, Immatured Funds, or Pledges. Because Immatured Funds may make up a portion of funds
                represented in a user's balance we make a
                good faith effort to avoid this action. It is utilized in the case of a fund reversal from a Contributor,
                e.g. a chargeback from their credit card, or other forms of fraud.

          %h3 Contributors
          %p
            %b 2.1 Pledge scope and cancellation.
            Contributors may create a Pledge to a Solution or Accepted Solution.
            Once a Pledge has been created Contributors may increase, decrease, or cancel the Pledge up until such time as
            the Solution is marked Completed by a Project Administrator. You acknowledge that a Project Administrator
            may mark a Solution as Completed at any time and is not controlled by Crowdlink.
          %p
            %b 2.2 Donation scope and cancellation.
            Donations may be made to Projects, Solutions, or Accepted Solutions. Donations may not be cancelled and are
            non-refundable. We reserve the right to refund a donation, and if you feel special circumstances apply
            please feel free to contact us at support@crowdlink.io.
          %p
            %b 2.3 Assignment of funds.
            Crowdlink holds Project Maintainers responsible for determining who Donations and Pledges will be paid out
            to. Project Maintainers may assign this power to a Project Administrator. Failure to completely assign
            funds to Assignees before a period of fourteen(14) days may result in funds being refunded to
            Contributors.
          %p
            %b 2.4 Crowdlink balances are not guaranteed.
            Assignees should not take any action in reliance on receiving funds from a Donation or Pledge
            even if Crowdlink updates their balance to include those funds. Crowdlink reserves the right to Reverse
            these funds, such as in the case
            of a chargeback from a Contributor. You acknowledge that Crowdlink will make a good faith effort to avoid
            this action, and agree to abide by whatever decision Crowdlink makes.
          %p
            %b 2.5 Contributions are not guaranteed.
            Crowdlink reserves the right to reject, cancel, interrupt, remove, or
            suspend a Donation or Pledge at any time and for any reason. Crowdlink is not liable for
            any damages as a result of any of those actions.
          %p
            %b 2.6 Marking Solutions as Completed.
            Project Administrators are responsible for properly
            reporting the Project status. Crowdlink
            does not receive, process or review Solutions or Solutions marked Completed. If you are a Project
            Administrator
            you represent, warrant and promise that any Solution marked completed by you or on your
            behalf was actually completed and accomplished. Crowdlink expressly disclaims any responsibility or
            liability in regards to the factual accuracy of Solutions marked as completed.
          %p
            %b 2.7 Selection of Accepted Solutions.
            An Accepted Solution will be selected
            by a Project Administrator by marking the Solution as accepted.
            Multiple Solutions may be marked as accepted. You agree not to make claims against Crowdlink or hold
            Crowdlink responsible in connection with the determination of an Accepted
            Solution.
          %p
            %b 2.8 Rejected Proposals.
            A Proposal may be rejected
            by a Project Administrator by marking the Proposal appropriately.
            You agree not to make claims against Crowdlink or hold
            Crowdlink responsible in connection with the determination of a rejected Proposal.
          %p
            %b 2.9 Liability.
            By participating in our Service, you agree that Crowdlink's good faith
            decisions will be final and not grounds for claims or litigation. Crowdlink
            shall not be liable to you, and you hereby release us from any and all claims,
            for any damages resulting from or in connection with of any such
            determinations.

            fees in connection with Donations and Pledges made to Assignees as described on the Crowdlink
            Fees Page. Crowdlink does not charge a fee for Contributors to transfer money to
            Crowdlink, but does pass along the transaction fees associated with the payment processor
            used. For example, Balanced Payments charges 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction.

            Crowdlink is a listing and project platform, and does not
            develop code, Solutions, or Projects itself. Any and all code and Solutions developed or made
            available through Crowdlink are developed by third parties. Such
            parties are not employees or agents of Crowdlink, and (if any payments are
            made) are treated as independent contractors. Accordingly, users of Crowdlink
            agree to release and hold harmless Crowdlink from and against any claims that
            code or Solutions are incomplete, do not work correctly, have bugs, or are
            otherwise unsuitable for a particular user's purpose. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
