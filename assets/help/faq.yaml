      title: What is Crowdlink?
      body: |
          Crowdlink is a platform for better communication between developers and end-users.
          Users can contribute towards projects they enjoy by making pledges or voting on
          new features and bugfixes. Developers can gain insight into their community's
          needs, and financial support for a growing project.
      breif: Crowdlink is a platform for better communication between developers and end-users.
  issue_tracker:
      title: Is Crowdlink an issue tracker?
      body: |
          No, not really. Although it could be used that way.
          <p><br>
          Crowdlink is designed to focus on communicating which improvements are the most valued by users.
          Towards that end, Crowdlink offers a logical workflow with community involvement integrated
          throughout the process.
          <br><p>The general idea is to have proposals function at a higher level than
          traditional issue tracker items, e.g. users may note that they are really frustrated with the support
          offered. The goal is
          to support decision making and project direction, rather than focusing on specific implementation details.
      brief: Crowdlink is designed to allow developers to make informed project direction decisions, rather than focusing on specific implementation details.
  how_works:
      title: How does Crowdlink work?
      body: |
          Crowdlink is built to be quite flexible, but a typical use case might be as follows:
          <br><p>
          <ul>
          <li>A user has a great idea to improve a project</li>
          <li>This user locates the project on Crowdlink and they create a proposal for their idea</li>
          <li>The user makes a pledge towards its completion</li>
          <li>Other users agree the idea is great and also contribute</li>
          <li>Developers, excited by the interest in the project, have a clear view of which improvements users value most.</li>
          <li>For particularly challenging ideas developers gain a route to communicate the difficulties</li>
          <li>After weighing the pros and cons they accept or reject an idea to let users know how they are going forward.</li>
          <li>If a solution is completed the developers receive the pledges.</li>
          </ul>
      brief: Users make pledges towards issues or solutions. Developers may complete those to receive the pledges.
  benefits:
      title: Why use Crowdlink?
      body: |
          <ul>
          <li>Watch projects you are interested in and see what direction they are moving</li>
          <li>Easily determine which issues are most important to your project's users</li>
          <li>Encourage & motivate developers who see interest in their project</li>
          <li>Contribute your ideas to other projects</li>
          <li>Maintain a logical workflow on public proposals</li>
          <li>Help developers make financial ends meet</li>
          </ul>
      brief: Crowdlink helps motivate developers, increases communication between devs and end users, and helps starving devs pay their bills.
  differences:
      title: How is Crowdlink different from other Crowdfunding sites, like BountySource or Gittip?
      body: |
          Crowdlink is a paradigm shift from other sites. Most other sites focus on incenting/rewarding devs,
          and we agree that aspect is important, but what really makes a project great (or horrible) is the community.
          Crowdlink is designed to grow that community. Involve users in the decision making process. Give developers
          valuable information about what the users want. Philosophy aside, there are also several key
          architectural differences
          <br><ul>
          <li><b>Microtransactions</b> - Its simple to make one, non-recurring donation or pledge.</li>
          <li><b>Project focused</b> - Supporting developers is important, and Crowdlink does that,
          but the focus is really on getting everyone working together</li>
          <li><b>Empowering</b> - Crowdlink gives project maintainers ultimate control over both project direction and fund distribution.</li>
      brief: Much community. So crowdfund. Wow.

  pledges:
      title: What are Pledges and how do they work?
      body: |
          A Pledge is a monetary endorsement of an idea. Once marked complete, Pledges are distributed by a project admin.
          Crowdlink allows Pledges to be placed on both Proposed Solutions (ideas for improving a project)
          and Accepted Solutions (Solutions that have been approved by project admins).
      brief: Much community. So crowdfund. Wow.
  unused_solutions:
      title: What happens to a Pledge if a Solution is not accepted?
      body: When a solution is rejected, or simply isn't picked any Pledges attached to it get returned to the contributor.
      brief: Much community. So crowdfund. Wow.
  pending_pledges:
      title: Why are some funds unable to be withdrawn?
      body: |
          For fraud prevention Crowdlink delays some funds from maturing based on a complex set of variables.
          <br><p><p>Because of this
          it will sometimes be the case that funds will be recieved, and available to be sent to others in Crowdlink's network,
          but not yet be available to withdraw.
          Currently, since Crowdlink is very new, we have set maturation to occur after a longer (safer) time period, and
          are working to build a model to hopefully shorten this period for most cases.
      brief: Much community. So crowdfund. Wow.
  fees:
      title: What is your fee structure?
      body: |
          <b>Incoming fees.</b> We pass along fees from payment processors. We are currently only setup to accept
          payments through Balanced Payments. Their fee structure:
          <p>
          <ul>
           <li>Credit cards: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction</li>
           <li>Bank ACH debits: 1% + $0.30 per transaction, max $5</li>
          </ul>
          <b>In-network fees.</b> We charge a 6% fee for transactions between users, e.g. Pledges or Donations to
          projects. This fee will likely change as we get a better feel for the traffic level.
          <br><p><p>
          <b>Exiting fees.</b> We pass along fees for this. Balanced charges $0.25 for a (next day) bank deposit
      brief: Much community. So crowdfund. Wow.
