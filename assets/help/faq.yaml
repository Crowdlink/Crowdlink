  what_is:
      title: What is Crowdlink?
      body: |
          Crowdlink is a platform for better communication between developers and end-users.
          Users can contribute towards projects they enjoy by making pledges or voting on
          new features and bugfixes. Developers can gain insight into their community's
          needs, and financial support for a growing project.
      breif: Crowdlink is a platform for better communication between developers and end-users.
  issue_tracker:
      title: Is Crowdlink an issue tracker?
      body: |
          <b>Not in the traditional sense.</b> Although you could certainly use it that way.
          Crowdlink is designed to offer a logical workflow with community involvement integrated
          throughout the process. The idea is to target issues at a much higher level than
          traditional issue trackers, IE. users may note a specific symptom of a bug they would really like
          fixed, without necessarily having any idea as to the cause or solution. The goal is
          to support decision making and project direction, rather than focusing on implementation details.
      brief: Crowdlink is designed to allow developers to make informed project direction decisions, rather than focusing on specific implementation details.
  how_works:
      title: How does Crowdlink work?
      body: |
          Crowdlink is built to by quite flexible, but a typical use case might be as follows:
          <br>
          <ul>
          <li>A user has a great idea to improve a project</li>
          <li>This user locates the project on Crowdlink and they create a new issue + solution for their idea</li>
          <li>The user makes a pledge towards its completion</li>
          <li>While viewing the project the user notices a couple other ideas he really likes, and pledges towards those too</li>
          <li>Developers, excited by the interest in the project, take note of popular issues.</li>
          <li>After careful consideration they select or reject an issue or solution to let users know how they are going forward.</li>
          <li>If a solution is completed the developers receive the pledges.</li>
          </ul>
      brief: Users make pledges towards issues or solutions. Developers may complete those to receive the pledges.
  benefits:
      title: Why use Crowdlink?
      body: |
          <ul>
          <li>Watch projects you are interested in and see what direction they are moving</li>
          <li>Easily determine which issues are most important to end users</li>
          <li>Encourage & motivate developers who see interest in their project</li>
          <li>Maintain a logical workflow of issues</li>
          <li>Help developers make financial ends meet</li>
          </ul>
      brief: Crowdlink helps motivate developers, increases communication between devs and end users, and helps starving devs pay their bills.
  differences:
      title: How is Crowdlink different from other Crowdfunding sites, like BountySource or Gittip?
      body: |
          Crowdlink is a paradigm shift from other sites. Most other sites focus on incenting/rewarding devs,
          and we agree that aspect is important, but what really makes a project great (or horrible) is the community.
          Crowdlink is designed to grow that community. Involve users in the decision making process. Give developers
          valuable information about what the users want. Philosophy aside, there are also several key
          architectural differences
          <br><ul>
          <li><b>Microtransactions</b> - Its simple to make one, non-recurring donation or pledge.</li>
          <li><b>Project focused</b> - Supporting developers is important, and Crowdlink does that,
          but the focus is really on getting everyone working together</li>
          <li><b>Empowering</b> - Crowdlink gives project maintainers ultimate control over both project direction and fund distribution.</li>
      brief: Much community. So crowdfund. Wow.

  pledges:
      title: What are Pledges and how do they work?
      body: |
          A Pledge is a monetary endorsement of an idea. Crowdlink allows Pledges to be placed on both Proposed Solutions (ideas for improving a project)
          and Accepted Solutions (Solutions that have been approved by project admins). Once a Solution is marked as completed the funds in a Pledge are
          dispursed by a project admin.
      brief: Much community. So crowdfund. Wow.

      title: What happens to a Pledge if a Solution is not accepted?
      body: When a solution is rejected, or simply isn't picked any Pledges attached to it get returned to the contributor.
      brief: Much community. So crowdfund. Wow.
  pending_earmarks:
      title: Why are funds pending on my account?
      body: |
          For fraud prevention Crowdlink delays fund from maturing based on a complex set of variables. Because of this
          it will sometimes be the case that funds will be recieved but not yet be available. After funds mature they
          may then be withdrawn or contributed towards other projects.
      brief: Much community. So crowdfund. Wow.
  fees:
      title: What is your fee structure?
      body: |
          <p>There are two types of fees possible on Crowdlink. The first is incurred when depositing or withdrawing money from Crowdlink.
          The other happens during the donation/pledge process.
          <p>For the first type of fee, the thought process is to pass payment processor fees on to the user when they deposit/withdraw from their account. This
          gives the user more control, and potentially allows them to reduce these transaction fees or increase convenience. At the moment Stripe is
          the only way to transfer money in or out of Crowdlink, although we plan to offer other payment processors soon.
          For now, this means there is a
          fee of 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction, because that is what Stripe charges. For withdrawl Stripe charge $0.50 per transaction.</p>
          <p>Payment processor fees are represented immediately after putting money in a Crowdlink account. For example, if a user puts a $20 charge towards his Crowdlink
          account the available balance will be $19.12.</p>
          <p>The other type of fee supports Crowdlink. It is a flat 4% fee for pledges and donations.
          This fee occurs any time funds move between Crowdlink users, and may change.
          For example, if a user Pledges $2.00 towards a solution then when that issue is completed the project maintainer will split
          $1.92 between users who contributed towards the solution.</p>
          <p>Our intent is to make the fee structure as straightforward as possible, and encourage people to make small but meaningful
          contributions, potentially donating a little bit to many different projects. If you have any questions please
          contact support, and suggestions are always welcome on our project page.
      brief: Much community. So crowdfund. Wow.
