      title: What is Crowdlink?
      body: |
          Crowdlink is a platform for better communication between project owners and their end-users.
          Users can contribute towards projects they enjoy by making pledges, voting, and donating on 
          different community proposed features or improvements. Project owners can gain insight into their community's
          needs while receiving financial support for their projects. This allows growing projects to
          bootstrap themselves with the help of the community.
      breif: Crowdlink is a platform for better communication between developers and end-users.
  issue_tracker:
      title: Is Crowdlink an issue tracker?
      body: |
          No, not really. Although it could be used that way.
          <p><br>
          Instead of focusing on project management like traditional issue trackers, Crowdlink is designed
          for community feedback first. Instead of Issues, Crowdlink has the concept of Problems, which
          focus on the high level view of a product, as opposed to its implementation details.
          </p>
          <p>
          For instance, a user might post a new Problem stating that they dislike the tabbed navigation on a website.
          The project owner and other users can vote on this Problem as well as contribute potential Solutions to it.
          Crowdlink also allows users to make microdonations and Pledges towards different Problems and Solutions, which
          is an uncommon feature in an issue tracker.
          </p>
      brief: Crowdlink is designed to allow developers to make informed project direction decisions, rather than focusing on specific implementation details.
  how_works:
      title: How does Crowdlink work?
      body: |
          Crowdlink is built to be quite flexible, but a typical use case might be as follows:
          <br><p>
          <ul>
          <li>A user has a great idea to improve a service or product they use</li>
          <li>This user locates the project on Crowdlink and they create a proposal for their idea</li>
          <li>The user makes a pledge towards its completion</li>
          <li>Other users agree the idea is great and also contribute</li>
          <li>Developers, excited by the interest in the project, have a clear view of which improvements users value most.</li>
          <li>For particularly challenging ideas developers gain a route to communicate the difficulties</li>
          <li>After weighing the pros and cons they accept or reject an idea to let users know how they are going forward.</li>
          <li>If a solution is completed the developers receive the pledges.</li>
          </ul>
      brief: Users make pledges towards issues or solutions. Developers may complete those to receive the pledges.

  differences:
      title: How is Crowdlink different from other Crowdfunding sites, like BountySource or Gittip?
      body: |
          Several key differences:
          <br><p><ul>
          <li><b>Microtransactions</b> - Its simple to make one, non-recurring donation or pledge.</li>
          <li><b>Project focused</b> - Supporting developers is important, and Crowdlink does that,
          but the focus is really on getting everyone working together</li>
          <li><b>Empowering</b> - Crowdlink gives project owners ultimate control over both project direction and fund distribution.</li>
      brief: Much community. So crowdfund. Wow.

  pledges:
      title: What are Pledges and how do they work?
      body: |
          A Pledge is a monetary endorsement of an idea. Once a Problem is marked as complete, pledged money is
          distributed by a project admin.
      brief: Much community. So crowdfund. Wow.
  unused_solutions:
      title: What happens to a Pledge if a Solution is not accepted?
      body: When a solution is rejected, or simply isn't picked any Pledges attached to it get returned to the contributor.
      brief: Much community. So crowdfund. Wow.
  pending_pledges:
      title: Why are some funds unable to be withdrawn?
      body: |
          For fraud prevention Crowdlink delays some funds from from being withdrawn from the network for a certain period of time.
          While funds are still in this 'maturing' state they can still be sent to other users, but cannot be withdrawn to a 
          bank account.
      brief: Much community. So crowdfund. Wow.
  fees:
      title: What is your fee structure?
      body: |
          <b>Incoming fees.</b> We pass along fees from payment processors. We are currently only setup to accept
          payments through Balanced Payments. Their fee structure:
          <p>
          <ul>
           <li>Credit cards: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction</li>
           <li>Bank ACH debits: 1% + $0.30 per transaction, max $5</li>
          </ul>
          <b>In-network fees.</b> We charge a 6% fee for transactions between users, e.g. Pledges or Donations to
          projects. This fee will likely change as we get a better feel for the traffic level.
          <br><p><p>
          <b>Exiting fees.</b> We pass along fees for this. Balanced charges $0.25 for a (next day) bank deposit
