Project owners can gain insight into their community's\nneeds while receiving financial support for their projects. This allows growing projects to\nbootstrap themselves with the help of the community.\n","breif":"Crowdlink is a platform for better communication between developers and end-users."},"issue_tracker":{"title":"Is Crowdlink an issue tracker?","body":"No, not really. Although it could be used that way.\n<p><br>\nInstead of focusing on project management like traditional issue trackers, Crowdlink is designed\nfor community feedback first. Instead of Issues, Crowdlink has the concept of Problems, which\nfocus on the high level view of a product, as opposed its implementation details.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor instance, a user might post a new Problem stating that they dislike the tabbed navigation on a website.\nThe project owner and other users can vote on this Problem as well as contribute potential Solutions to it.\nCrowdlink also allows users to make microdonations and Pledges towards different Problems and Solutions, which\nis an uncommon feature in an issue tracker.\n</p>\n","brief":"Crowdlink is designed to allow developers to make informed project direction decisions, rather than focusing on specific implementation details."},"how_works":{"title":"How does Crowdlink work?","body":"Crowdlink is built to be quite flexible, but a typical use case might be as follows:\n<br><p>\n<ul>\n<li>A user has a great idea to improve a service or product they use</li>\n<li>This user locates the project on Crowdlink and they create a proposal for their idea</li>\n<li>The user makes a pledge towards its completion</li>\n<li>Other users agree the idea is great and also contribute</li>\n<li>Developers, excited by the interest in the project, have a clear view of which improvements users value most.</li>\n<li>For particularly challenging ideas developers gain a route to communicate the difficulties</li>\n<li>After weighing the pros and cons they accept or reject an idea to let users know how they are going forward.</li>\n<li>If a solution is completed the developers receive the pledges.</li>\n</ul>\n","brief":"Users make pledges towards issues or solutions. Developers may complete those to receive the pledges."},"benefits":{"title":"Why use Crowdlink?","body":"<ul>\n<li>Watch projects you are interested in and monitor upcoming awesome features</li>\n<li>Easily determine which issues are important with voting, pledges and donations</li>\n<li>Encourage project owners by giving small amounts to show your interest and help them grow</li>\n<li>Motivate project owners to fix problems that are bugging you by Pledging towards their completion</li>\n<li>Contribute your ideas to projects you care about</li>\n</ul>\n","brief":"Crowdlink helps motivate developers, increases communication between devs and end users, and helps starving devs pay their bills."},"differences":{"title":"How is Crowdlink different from other Crowdfunding sites, like BountySource or Gittip?","body":"Several key differences:\n<br><p><ul>\n<li><b>Microtransactions</b> - Its simple to make one, non-recurring donation or pledge.</li>\n<li><b>Project focused</b> - Supporting developers is important, and Crowdlink does that,\nbut the focus is really on getting everyone working together</li>\n<li><b>Empowering</b> - Crowdlink gives project maintainers ultimate control over both project direction and fund distribution.</li>\n","brief":"Much community.

So crowdfund. Wow."},"fees":{"title":"What is your fee structure?","body":"<b>Incoming fees.</b> We pass along fees from payment processors. We are currently only setup to accept\npayments through Balanced Payments. Their fee structure:\n<p>\n<ul>\n <li>Credit cards: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction</li>\n <li>Bank ACH debits: 1% + $0.30 per transaction, max $5</li>\n</ul>\n<b>In-network fees.</b> We charge a 6% fee for transactions between users, e.g. Pledges or Donations to\nprojects.
